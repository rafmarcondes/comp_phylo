This is code written to complete a discrete sampling exercise for Jeremy Brown's CompPhylo class at LSU, Spring 2015.
Comments preceded by "INSTRUCTIONS" are Jeremy's literal instructions for the exercise; all other comments are mine.
"""

"""INSTRUCTIONS: (1) Write a function that multiplies all consecutively decreasing numbers between a maximum and 
a minimum supplied as arguments. (Like a factorial, but not necessarily going all the way to 1).
"""

def consecMulti(min,max) :
#the function is named after 'consecutive multiplication'. Its arguments are the minimum and maximum values. The
#output is the result of the multiplication, and it is not automatically printed to the screen
    result=max
    for i in range (min,max) :
        result=result*i
    return result
